Description: It provides convenience tools for creating and analyzing 
    'k-mers'. It aims at supporting the building of databases. Therefore, 
    here the focus is on tools to routinely process 'fasta' and 
    'fastq' formatted DNA sequence data into efficient file formats for further 
    processing like querying and filtering. It features a tool to check on 
    possible 'k-mer' sizes using a genomic response approach, as well as a 
    plotting function to map k-mer matches against a reference sequence quickly.
