see tutorial basic

fully replace calc_k_half with calc_k_limit

# Missing machinery
- prefilitering with shortreads being strict on quality and information content
- deduplicate
- subsample only up to a total of 10 Mio per genotype!
- or consider removing the 95% most common kmers!
  - check on 
- prepare some examples for potato on spark!
- map kmers
- screen kmers for min k
- add f guess to kmer count

- add file directory as input to kmer count

- add map plot functions for kmers
- a spectra plot functions

- evaluate effect of indels! can it detect?

- convenience function get kmer table from database

- rmd website for tutorials!
- put specifici tutorials on other web site: netlify
- add tutorial for installation of platform also on other website


- simple web site for phenotypic data
- simple BrAPI server

# Missing genome scans
- do with potato! Present some preliminary results
