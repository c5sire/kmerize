see tutorial basic

fully replace calc_k_half with calc_k_limit

# Next tutorials

# Missing machinery
- prefilitering with shortreads being strict on quality and information content
- deduplicate
- subsample only up to a total of 10 Mio per genotype!
- or consider removing the 95% most common kmers!
  - check on 
- prepare some examples for potato on spark!
- map kmers
- screen kmers for min k
- add f guess to kmer count
- 

- add file directory as input to kmer count

- add map plot functions for kmers
- a spectra plot functions

- evaluate effect of indels! can it detect?

- convenience function get kmer table from database

- rmd website for tutorials!
- put specifici tutorials on other web site: netlify
- add tutorial for installation of platform also on other website


- simple web site for phenotypic data
- simple BrAPI server

# Missing genome scans
- do with potato! Present some preliminary results
- additional package with project oriented data and tutorials: kmore

# Feb 12
- finish kmer position coverage
- test_that
- check on mac and linux
- transfer potato sample to new package
- new package kmore
- tutorials in kmore 
- include preprocessing to filter only high quality and highly informative sequences
- add spectrum plot
- elaborate in tutorial
- function to query kmers as a set of GenomicRanges?
- save?
- add coverage plot

- add more package safety net as in ace2fastq
- CI, etc
- Readme
- web page

- website with precompiled binaries for easier download
- examples with genomes
- 

- send instructions

- transfer atlas files to Amsterdam cloud
- run
